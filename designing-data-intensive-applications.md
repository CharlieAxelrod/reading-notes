# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Part 1: Foundations of Data Systems

### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

A data-intensive application is one in which data operations and quantity are a limiting factor. Data operations could include database reads and writes, searches, caches, batch processing, and stream processing.

Complex data systems often combine multiple data storage and processing tools, each of which performs distinct tasks. Application code then stitches these tools together, seeking to ensure the **reliability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** of the composite data system.
